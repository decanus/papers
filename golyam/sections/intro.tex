In this paper we describe a set of simple changes that can be made to the RPC messages of Kademlia\cite{kademlia} allowing it to be compatible with Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols. The changes are largely inspired by other Kademlia inspired protocols such as discv5\cite{discv5}. Our focus is on enabling lookups aided by computational PIR queries.

@TODO PROBABLY NEEDS SOME MORE.
